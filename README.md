# Fawaz Tarar

I am passionate iOS Engineer experienced in SwiftUI, Combine, and Firebase, with a strong foundation in watchOS.
I enjoy creating clean, high-performance, user-friendly apps that combine design, data, and emotion.
I’m actively building and evolving StepPlay, a next-generation fitness and wellness app integrating HealthKit, watchOS, Apple Music (MusicKit), CallKit, and CarPlay to deliver data-driven motivation through real-time HRV tracking, gamified milestones, and social engagement.
I follow MVVM and SOLID principles to ensure scalable, testable, and energy-efficient code — and I’m driven by curiosity, collaboration, and commitment to  continuous learning.
